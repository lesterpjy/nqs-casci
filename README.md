Neural-network quantum state for exact diagonalization in CAS-CI calculations

This work published on [JCTC](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.9b01132) utilize Boltzmann machine (BM) architectures as an encoder of *ab initio* molecular many-electron wave functions represented with the complete active space configuration interaction (CAS-CI) model. This ansatz termed neural-network quantum state or NQS, as first introduced by Carleo and Troyer in their seminal [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02318), is utilized here for finding a variationally optimal form of the ground-state wave function on the basis of the energy minimization
